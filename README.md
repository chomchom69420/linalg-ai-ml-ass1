# Linear Algebra for AI and ML Assignment 1

## Dataset extraction and analysis code for Microeconometrics project

This project aims to use a bit of linear algebra to classify and reconstruct images.

Python version 3.12.1 has been used.  

## Setting up the python environment
- Install Python, set up a new virtual environment
- Run the following command to install all python packages required for running this code: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Dataset
- Download the `.npy` files of the Olivetti face dataset from [this Google Drive link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/16f8bOX63I2QEtkeWzbE593M3dDMctaUU?usp=sharing) 
- 'olivetti_faces_target.npy' contains the class labels
- 'olivetti_faces.npy' contains the face data
